Description: Implements the Improved Expectation Maximisation EM* and the traditional EM algorithm for clustering 
    finite gaussian mixture models for both multivariate and univariate datasets. The initialization is done by randomly 
    selecting the samples from the dataset as the mean (meu) of the Gaussian(s). This version implements the faster alternative 
    EM* that avoids revisiting data by leveraging the heap structure. The algorithm returns a set of Gaussian 
    parameters-posterior probabilities, mean (meu), co-variance matrices (multivariate)/standard-deviation
    (univariate) and priors. Reference: Hasan Kurban, Mark Jenne, Mehmet M. Dalkilic (2016) <doi:10.1007/s41060-017-0062-1>.
