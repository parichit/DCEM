Description: Implements the Improved Expectation Maximisation EM* and the traditional EM algorithm for clustering 
    big data (gaussian mixture models for both multivariate and univariate datasets). This version 
    implements the faster alternative EM* that avoids revisiting data by leveraging the heap structure. 
    The implementation supports both random and K-means++ based initialization. Reference: Hasan Kurban, Mark Jenne,
